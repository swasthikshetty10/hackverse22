The board has lost its lustre over time.\nIt needs urgent revamping.\n* I found the artifacts kept outside were neglected. Exposed to the elements of nature.\nWhich I felt was unwise.\n*According to the museum Brochure the entrance fees for adults is 2₹.\nHowever the museum charges 20 ₹.\nThis needs to be corrected.\n\nSummary.\nThe museum has seen great improvement over the years.\nThe curator of the museum was really friendly and supportive. They do encourage school tours .\nI truly believe that the citizens are missing out on a treasure trove by not visiting out museum.\nGet lost in the beauty of the museum.\nGive it a shot. #crushit",

I think the entrance fee is too high for the facilities available inside the park.\n\nThere are only 2 big pools in the park. One family pool and one pool into which the water rides take you. Of these, you can only enjoy in the family pool as the lifeguards will not let you stay in the other pool. Both the pools are not deep enough for adults(maximum 3 feet deep). There is no wave pool.\n\nThere are only 7 water rides available in the park. Nothing else. No mechanical rides. So you will end up going in the same rides again and again.\n\nYou are not supposed to bring food from outside. You will have to be happy with what they serve at prices that are a bit high in the canteen within the premises.\n\nThey charge you for lockers. Daily rent of ₹ 50/- for small ones and ₹ 100 for bigger ones. Swimming costumes and accessories available for rent and purchase there. The changing rooms and washrooms are clean enough.\n\nI visited the park on a Sunday. Even then, the park was not that crowded and was able to spent some great time with my friends.\n\nThe park will open at 10:30 am and close at 5:00 pm.",
